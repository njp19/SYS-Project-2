# SYS-Project-2
There is a bug in the system that results in a core dump every once in a while. The grader could run the autograder 5 times in a row and it would be fine, then a 6th time and a core dump is thrown, then none the next. The core dump is thrown by random. If this happens putty should be rerestart.
